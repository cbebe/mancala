# Hi, I'm Charles

I am a student currently working on stuff I find fun (such as this game!)

## Charles's community Mancala game





This is Sungka, a Philippine mancala game. Anyone is free to participate! Click here for the [rules](https://mancala.fandom.com/wiki/Sungka#Rules).

Direction of sowing is counter-clockwise (top goes to the left, bottom goes to the right).

It's top side's turn! Choose a hole to move.
