This is Sungka, a Philippine mancala game. :wave: Anyone is free to participate!
 **Click on one of the holes** in the board to make a move. If you're not familiar with the game, click here for the [rules](https://mancala.fandom.com/wiki/Sungka#Rules).

Direction of sowing is **counter-clockwise** (top goes to the left, bottom goes to the right).

It's **bottom** team's turn :muscle:! Choose a hole to move.
